					<Heading3>Who designed the latin alphabet?</Heading3>
					<Paragraph>Have you ever wondered why letters look the way they do? For example, why does the latin letter "A" look like that? The answer sounded surprising to me.</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>Turns out, a couple milennia ago, in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the word for "Ox" used to be represented by a drawing of a head of an ox, turned sideways:</Paragraph>

					<Paragraph>When I'm writing this, it's currently the 21st century. There is a human-made robot traveling on the surface of Mars. The robot is called Perseverance. The "A" in its name looks like that because of... how someone chose to draw an ox 5000 years ago.</Paragraph>
