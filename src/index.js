					<Subtitle>An alphabet that makes sense</Subtitle>
					<Paragraph>Vishvaksara is a featural constructed alphabet, where every part of a letter describes a certain feature of the sound that letter represents. Because of this system, the more similar two letters are, the more similar their sounds are. So if you misread a letter slightly, it will still be a similar sound to what's written.</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>Letterforms in Vishvaksara were chosen so that the most used sounds have the simplest letter shapes, so that writing is as fast as possible. Consonants can be written in a cursive-like way, without lifting the pen, and vowels can be omitted to make writing even faster, creating a sort-of shorthand.</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>Vishvaksara is designed to be universal: it can be used to write the native languages of at least 3.6 billion people, including English, Mandarin, Yue, Wu, Hindi, Spanish and Standard Arabic.</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>I designed Vishvaksara as a hobby, for fun. Maybe it could be useful for you as a cipher, or for a fictional language? You're free to use it for your non-commercial hobby projects if you credit me and link back to this page. If you want to use it commercially, contact me!</Paragraph>

					<Heading3>Who designed the latin alphabet?</Heading3>
					<Paragraph>Have you ever wondered why letters look the way they do? For example, why does the latin letter "A" look like that? The answer sounded surprising to me.</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>Turns out, a couple milennia ago, in Egyptian hieroglyphs, the word for "Ox" used to be represented by a drawing of a head of an ox, turned sideways:</Paragraph>
					<EgyptianCharacter>ìÉæ</EgyptianCharacter>
					<Paragraph>Then, in the 19-15th century BC, the Canaanites developed a new script for themselves, basing it on those Egyptian hieroglyphs. Their script described sounds, not concepts. For the sound "A", they chose the hieroglyph for "Ox", because the word for "Ox" sounded like "'alp" in Egyptian.</Paragraph>
					<StyledProtoSemiticAleph />
					<Paragraph> Then, hundreds of years later, the Phoenicians developed a new script, basing it on the Canaanite script. They simplified the shape even more. Now, the letter they called " æƒÅlep" looked like this:</Paragraph>
					<BigCharacter>ê§Ä</BigCharacter>
					<Paragraph> Then, hundreds of years later, the Greek developed a new script, basing it on the Phoenician script. For some reason, they decided to turn the Phoenician letter on its side. Now, the letter they called "alpha" looked like this:</Paragraph>
					<BigCharacter>A</BigCharacter>
					<Paragraph>Then the Etruscans copied it, and the Romans copied it, and it became the latin A we all know. People chiseled it, wrote it with pens, adapted it for the printing press and then displayed it on screens.</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>When I'm writing this, it's currently the 21st century. There is a human-made robot traveling on the surface of Mars. The robot is called Perseverance. The "A" in its name looks like that because of... how someone chose to draw an ox 5000 years ago.</Paragraph>
